## Who am I?

Hello! :wave: My name is Charlie Shou and (as of the last time I've updated this website) I am a second year student studying Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley.

## What do you do?

Currently, I'm interested in full-stack development and system design, but hope to get more experience in data science and AI/ML in the future. As of now, I'm working part-time as a software engineer at [Polyture](https://www.polyture.com/) along with other school stuff.

Outside of work and school, I'm part of [Cal Dragon Boat](https://caldragonboat.berkeley.edu/). I also enjoy skiing, working out, hiking, and want to get into scuba diving.
